# Math Arcade
This is a suite of some games for the TI 84 Plus CE, written in C and using the [C/C++ CE Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain).
To compile, download the toolchain and place the bin/ directory on your PATH. Then, run make in the project directory and move the .8xp file and the clibs.8xg file to your calculator using file transferring software such as CE Connect (Windows/Mac) or tilp (Linux). Note that if you're using Linux, tilp may need special (root) permissions to access the cable connection.
The download for clibs.8xg can be found on the toolchain's Releases page.

# History
The MVP was written from 11/5/22 to 11/6/22 by me in 24 hours. Since then, the code has been refactored, commented, and made easier to understand. No new (noticable) features or games have been added since then.
